<h2>1. Weathering with you</h2>
<p>One of the most comfy, viby movies I have ever watched. I loved the main character and handling of slice of life elements. I have never wished to be a main character in a movie as much as I did in this one. Also one of the few movies I have ever rewatched.</p>
<h2>2. American Psycho</h2>
<p>No movie has ever exceeded my expectations as this one did. When I wanted to watch it, I just wanted to see popular scenes from memes that I have seen so many times before. Instead, I got a funny, brutal and deep insight into an unbelievably complex character that Patrick Bateman is.</p>
<h2>3.Never let me go</h2>
<p>Although I read the book first, the movie has added more emotions to this incredibly constructed story. Making it one of the few movies that I have ever cried while watching</p>
